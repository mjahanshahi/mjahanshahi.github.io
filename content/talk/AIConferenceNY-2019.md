# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Word embeddings such as word2vec have revolutionized language modelling. In this talk I will discuss exponential family embeddings, which apply probabilistic embedding models to other data types. I describe how we implemented a dynamic embedding model to understand how tech skill-sets have changed over 3 years. The key takeaway is that these models can enrich analysis of specialized datasets."
