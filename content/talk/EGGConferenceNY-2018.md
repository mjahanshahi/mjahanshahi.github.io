# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "In contrast to many other business functions, most companies typically approach hiring and talent management as an art relying on judgment and experience, rather than a science, relying on benchmarks and metrics. At TapRecruit, we interrogate these “common sense” judgments to see if they help or hurt hiring teams in competitive talent markets, especially for technology and data science roles. My research group studies these hiring heuristics and in this talk, I will discuss counter-intuitive patterns that have significant impacts on hiring."
