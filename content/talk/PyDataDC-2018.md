# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Although data-driven approaches have become commonplace in many business decisions, hiring remains a (dark) art, subject to many minor snap judgments that are proven to impact the fairness and outcomes of the process. At TapRecruit, we combine natural language processing, data, and decision sciences, to interrogate these 'common sense' judgments and mitigate their impact when hiring for tech and data science roles. This talk will discuss the unique challenges of parsing and interpreting career language data and the results of combining analyses of millions of jobs (and their outcomes) with behavioral experiments. You will leave with concrete advice on how to hire data scientists and data engineers more fairly and efficiently."
