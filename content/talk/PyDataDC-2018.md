# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Although data-driven approaches have become commonplace in many business decisions, hiring remains a (dark) art, subject to many minor snap judgments that are proven to impact the fairness and outcomes of the process. At TapRecruit, we combine natural language processing, data, and decision sciences, to interrogate these 'common sense' judgments and mitigate their impact when hiring for tech and data science roles. This talk will discuss the unique challenges of parsing and interpreting career language data and the results of combining analyses of millions of jobs (and their outcomes) with behavioral experiments. You will leave with concrete advice on how to hire data scientists and data engineers more fairly and efficiently."
#abstract_orig = "What if I told you that I could debilitate your ability to hire a data scientist by altering just 10 innocuous words in a job description? In this talk, I guide you through the real-world outcomes of how common attributes in data science job descriptions can result in a job taking weeks longer to fill and tens of thousands of dollars wasted. I discuss: (1) how innocuous, commonly used words in job posts can significantly slow down hiring; (2) how adding more requirements often lowers applicant quality instead of raising it; and, (3) how the most boring signals can sometimes be the most important in driving qualified applicants."
