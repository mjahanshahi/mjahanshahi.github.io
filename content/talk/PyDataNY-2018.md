abstract = "In this talk I will discuss exponential family embeddings, which are methods that extend the idea behind word embeddings to other data types. I will describe how we used dynamic embeddings to understand how data science skill-sets have transformed over the last 3 years using our large corpus of jobs. The key takeaway is that these models can enrich analysis of specialized datasets."
