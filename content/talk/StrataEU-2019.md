# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Many data scientists are familiar with word embedding models such as word2vec, which capture semantic similarity among words and phrases in a corpus. However, word embeddings are limited in their ability to interrogate a corpus alongside other context or over time. Moreover, word embedding models either need significant amounts of data, or tuning through transfer learning of a domain-specific vocabulary that is unique to most commercial applications."
