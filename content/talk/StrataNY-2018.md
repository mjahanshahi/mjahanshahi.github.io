# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "Companies approach hiring and talent management as an art relying on judgment and experience when conceptualizing jobs, drafting JDs, and screening and assessing candidates. With recent advances in NLP, data science and decision science, we have the ability to interrogate these 'common sense' judgments to see if they help or hurt hiring teams in competitive talent markets, especially for technology and data science roles. In this talk, I will discuss how hiring heuristics impact fairness and efficiency using three behavioral studies that I recently conducted and my analyses of over 10 million jobs and their outcomes."
abstract_short = "Hiring teams have long-relied on intuition and experience to scout talent. Increased data and data-science techniques give us a chance to test common recruiting wisdom. Maryam will draw on results from her recent behavioral experiments and analyses of over 10 million jobs and their outcomes to illustrate how often innocuous recruiting decisions have dramatic impacts on hiring outcomes."
