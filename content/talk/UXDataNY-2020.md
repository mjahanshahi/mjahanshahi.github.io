# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "In the space of two months, COVID has caused major changes in our environments that seemed beyond belief if you had predicted them at the start of the year. Significant hardship has been felt by those most vulnerable (and least able to endure it). For those of us fortunate enough to remain employed, we’ve seen the large-scale adoption of remote work and the growing adoption of surveillance technologies that both enable and measure productivity. These have widespread, long-term ramifications on the fabric of our societies, communities and lives. To gain insights on how these changes are going to impact our working lives, Maryam will describe analysis conducted on job descriptions and their outcomes. She will describe: • Industries and role-types that showed weaker and stronger impacts by COVID-19. • Early trends from the opening up of the economy: industry and job types to watch. • The significance of remote work in post-COVID job landscapes."
