    abstract = {Author Summary Exquisite control of organ size is critical during animal development and its loss results in pathological conditions. The Hippo Tumor Suppressor Pathway coordinates regulation of proliferation, growth, apoptosis, and autophagy to determine and maintain precise control of organ size. However, the genes responsible for Hippo-mediated regulation of mitosis or coordination of proliferation within organ size control have evaded characterization. Here, we describe Rae1, an essential WD-repeat containing protein, as a new organ size regulator. By genetic analysis, we show that Rae1 acts downstream of the Hippo Pathway to regulate mitotic cyclins and organ size. In contexts where organ size control is lost by compromised Hippo signaling, we show that there is a requirement for Rae1 that is distinct from the requriement for Yki: reducing Yki levels causes suppression of overgrowth, while reducing Rae1 levels dramatically compromises the survival of Hippo-deficient tissue. Lastly, our studies of Rae1 uncovered a potential post-transcriptional feedback loop that reinforces Yorkie-mediated transcriptional feedback for the Hippo Pathway.},
