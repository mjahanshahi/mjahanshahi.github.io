Every day, we encounter hundreds of algorithms that predict our preferences, viewpoints and behaviors. In a world where computing power and data are both cheap and plentiful, predictive algorithms have the ability to automate significant tranches of decision-making. The scale of these decisions is without parallel. Nowhere is the harm more obvious than in the field of HR. From targeted job recommendations on social networks to algorithmic 'matching' of candidates, algorithms have the ability to severely restrict career opportunities and further harm historically marginalized communities. How do we build and use algorithmic tools responsibly in HR? In this talk, Maryam introduces the idea of the 'bias stack' and how it applies to both data and algorithms. Using real examples of recruiting studies, she highlights key considerations for HR-based algorithms.","tags":[],"title":"Algorithmic Responsibility in HR and Recruiting","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1589239483,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589239483,"objectID":"3f9ba447b0f351020d0b4df832691130","permalink":"/talk/yowdataonline-2020/","publishdate":"2020-05-11T19:24:43-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/yowdataonline-2020/","section":"talk","summary":"Many data scientists are familiar with word embedding models such as word2vec, which capture semantic similarity of words in a large corpus.

In this talk, I will introduce exponential family embeddings. Developed by Rudolph and Blei, these methods extend the idea of word embeddings to other types of high-dimensional data. I will demonstrate how they can be used to conduct advanced topic modeling on datasets that are medium-sized, which are specialized enough to require significant modifications of a word2vec model and contain more general data types (including categorical, count, continuous).

How the pathway coordinates restricting proliferation with organ size control remains a major unanswered question. Here we identify Rae1 as a highly-conserved target of the Hippo Pathway integrating proliferation and organ size. Genetic and biochemical studies in Drosophila cells and tissues and in mammalian cells indicate that Hippo signaling promotes Rae1 degradation downstream of Warts/Lats. In proliferating cells, Rae1 loss restricts cyclin B levels and organ size while Rae1 over-expression increases cyclin B levels and organ size, similar to Hippo Pathway over-activation or loss-of-function, respectively. Importantly, Rae1 regulation by the Hippo Pathway is crucial for its regulation of cyclin B and organ size; reducing Rae1 blocks cyclin B accumulation and suppresses overgrowth caused by Hippo Pathway loss. Surprisingly, in addition to suppressing overgrowth, reducing Rae1 also compromises survival of epithelial tissue overgrowing due to loss of Hippo signaling leading to a tissue “synthetic lethality” phenotype. Excitingly, Rae1 plays a highly conserved role to reduce the levels and activity of the Yki/YAP oncogene. Rae1 increases activation of the core kinases Hippo and Warts and plays a post-transcriptional role to increase the protein levels of the Merlin, Hippo, and Warts components of the pathway; therefore, in addition to Rae1 coordinating organ size regulation with proliferative control, we propose that Rae1 also acts in a feedback circuit to regulate pathway homeostasis.","tags":null,"title":"The Hippo Pathway Targets Rae1 to Regulate Mitosis and Organ Size and to Feed Back to Regulate Upstream Components Merlin, Hippo, and Warts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hongyan Zou, Rui Feng, Yong Huang, Joseph Tripodi, Vesna Najfeld, Nadejda M.

We have generated a mouse model of malignant glioma based on knock-in of a mutant PDGF receptor α (PDGFRα) that is expressed in oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) after activation by a Cre recombinase. In the tumor suppressor INK4/Arf−/− background, mutant animals frequently developed brain tumors resembling anaplastic human gliomas (WHO grade III). Besides brain tumors, most animals also developed aggressive fibrosarcomas, likely triggered by Cre activation of mutant PDGFRα in fibroblastic cell lineages. Importantly, in the brain tumors and cell lines derived from brain tumor tissues, we identified a high prevalence of DM Pdgfra gene amplification, suggesting its occurrence as an early mutational event contributing to the malignant transformation of OPCs. Amplicons extended beyond the Pdgfra locus and included in some cases neighboring genes Kit and Kdr. Our genetically defined mouse brain tumor model therefore supports OPC as a cell of origin for malignant glioma and offers an example of a defined temporal sequence of mutational events, thus providing an entry point for a mechanistic understanding of DM gene amplification and its functionality in gliomagenesis.","tags":null,"title":"Double minute amplification of mutant PDGF receptor α in a mouse glioma model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Anoj Ilanges, Maryam Jahanshahi, Denis Balobin, Cathie Pfleger"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1382328000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1382328000,"objectID":"8ff01e4cbb61ba1e8b81940377ae79a0","permalink":"/publication/hippo-alcohol/","publishdate":"2013-10-21T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/hippo-alcohol/","section":"publication","summary":"Alcohol-mediated cancers represent more than 3.5% of cancer-related deaths, yet how alcohol promotes cancer is a major open question. Using Drosophila, we identified novel interactions between dietary ethanol and loss of tumor suppressor components of the Hippo Pathway. The Hippo Pathway suppresses tumors in flies and mammals by inactivating transcriptional co-activator Yorkie, and the spectrum of cancers associated with impaired Hippo signaling overlaps strikingly with those associated with alcohol. Therefore, our findings may implicate loss of Hippo Pathway tumor suppression in alcohol-mediated cancers. Ethanol enhanced overgrowth from loss of the expanded, hippo, or warts tumor suppressors but, surprisingly, not from over-expressing the yorkie oncogene. We propose that in parallel to Yorkie-dependent overgrowth, impairing Hippo signaling in the presence of alcohol may promote overgrowth via additional alcohol-relevant targets. We also identified interactions between alcohol and Hippo Pathway over-activation. We propose that exceeding certain thresholds of alcohol exposure activates Hippo signaling to maintain proper growth control and prevent alcohol-mediated mis-patterning and tissue overgrowth.","tags":null,"title":"Alcohol Interacts with Genetic Alteration of the Hippo Tumor Suppressor Pathway to Modulate Tissue Growth in Drosophila","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hua Yan, Maryam Jahanshahi, Elizabeth Horvath, Hsiu-Yu Liu, Cathie Pfleger"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1281412800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1281412800,"objectID":"dbc62ac1929c6be959d2d49778a50657","permalink":"/publication/rabex5-ras/","publishdate":"2010-08-10T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/rabex5-ras/","section":"publication","summary":"The Ras signaling pathway allows cells to translate external cues into diverse biological responses. Depending on context and the threshold reached, Ras signaling can promote growth, proliferation, differentiation, or cell survival. Failure to maintain precise control of Ras can have adverse physiological consequences. Indeed, excess Ras signaling disrupts developmental patterning and causes developmental disorders [1, 2], and in mature tissues, it can lead to cancer [3–5]. We identify Rabex-5 as a new component of Ras signaling crucial for achieving proper pathway outputs in multiple contexts in vivo. We show that Drosophila Rabex-5 restricts Ras signaling to establish organism size, wing vein pattern, and eye versus antennal fate. Rabex-5 has both Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity that regulates endocytic trafficking [6] and ubiquitin ligase activity [7, 8]. Surprisingly, overexpression studies demonstrate that Rabex-5 ubiquitin ligase activity, not its Rab5 GEF activity, is required to restrict wing vein specification and to suppress the eye phenotypes of oncogenic Ras expression. Furthermore, genetic interaction experiments indicate that Rabex-5 acts at the step of Ras, and tissue culture studies show that Rabex-5 promotes Ras ubiquitination. Together, these findings reveal a new mechanism for attenuating Ras signaling in vivo and suggest an important role for Rabex-5-mediated Ras ubiquitination in pathway homeostasis.","tags":null,"title":"Rabex-5 Ubiquitin Ligase Activity Restricts Ras Signaling to Establish Pathway Homeostasis in Drosophila","type":"publication"}]
